- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SafeiaSherif. I am a recent graduate from the Decision Support Department at Cairo University's Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence.
- ðŸ‘€ I have always been a numbers person, with exceptional mathematics and computer skills. I am good in some data management systems and software such as Excel and python programming language.
      As much as I am into data manipulation, it is the analysis of data that really gets me going. I like to explore the relationships between numbers, and translate digits and spreadsheets into stories. In the age of big data, these stories become actionable solutions and strategies for businesses.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Financial analysis in deaper.
